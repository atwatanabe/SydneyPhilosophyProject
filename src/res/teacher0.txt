I see you’re back.
How was it today?
1. [It was really good!]    2. [Today had a lot of surprises.],    3. [It was so tiring!]    4. [Walk away]
Oh really? What happened today?
Wow! You sure did a lot today!
I’m really glad you’re getting used to it here. 
This place is your new home,
so always feel free to come to me for anything you ever need, alright?
