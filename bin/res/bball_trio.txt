Them: Look, we really don’t want you to play with us. Yeah, we’ll just have three people.
Black Girl: Well…why can’t I play and make it an even team?
P3: Uh, because you’re a girl and the team with the girl on it is obviously going to lose..?
You: [Talk]  [Walk away]
You:[Hey, that’s not cool!]  [Well, how do you know she’s bad just because she’s a girl?]  [Walk away]
Them: What? It’s true. Girls aren’t good at shooting hoops.
You:[Well, why don’t you just let us try before judging?]  [You guys are scum]  [Actually, I’m pretty good at it, and this girl also happens to be my friend, and we practice all the time.] [Walk away]
Them: Fine then, go ahead. If you can shoot 5 hoops in a row, we’ll let your friend join.

Them: …fine,  your friend can play. Happy now?
You: [Yeah, I’m happy I proved you all wrong.] [I just hope you guys stop grouping all girls together.]  3. [Walk away]
Them: What do you mean by that?
You: [Some girls might be bad at this, some girls might be good.]  [We’re all different, and we all have different talents.]  [Not all of us suck at basketball, ok?]  [Walk away]
Them: Yeah, I guess so. You’re better at shooting than he is! Hey! I’m better at doing assists than you at least!
You: [See, even you guys have different skills.]  [Yeah, see my point yet?]  [Walk away]
Them: Yeah, we do see what you mean now…thanks for telling us. Hey, come on! Let’s all play already!
